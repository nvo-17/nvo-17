        <p class="intro"> A constellation is a group of stars that forms a recognizable pattern in the night sky. 
            These patterns are often named after mythological figures, animals, or objects. 
            There are 88 officially recognized constellations, each with its own unique shape and story. 
            Some of the most well-known constellations include Orion, Ursa Major (the Big Dipper), 
            and Cassiopeia. Constellations have been used for navigation, storytelling, and as a way to organize the night sky for centuries. 
            They continue to captivate stargazers and astronomers alike. </p>
